# Little Beak Cluck

A 2D action game where you play as a brave little chicken defending against waves of enemies using the power of your voice!

## Gameplay

You're a chicken with a special ability - your scream can defeat enemies. Hold down the attack button to charge up your voice, then release to unleash devastating sound waves. The longer you charge, the more powerful your attack becomes!

## Mechanics

### Voice Attack System
- **Charging**: Hold to build up power (0.5s minimum, 3s maximum)
- **Wave Count**: 
  - Quick tap = single wave
  - Medium charge = double wave
  - Full charge = triple wave attack
- **Frequency Types**: Switch between High, Mid, and Low frequency waves, each dealing with enemies differently

### Game Modes

**Campaign Mode**  
Fight through carefully designed enemy waves. Each wave gets progressively harder, but you get full health back between rounds. Beat all waves to win!

**Endless Mode**  
See how long you can survive against infinite procedurally generated waves. You'll get small healing during cooldowns between waves, but enemies just keep coming. How far can you go?
